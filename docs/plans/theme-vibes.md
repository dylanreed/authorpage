# AuthorPage Theme Vibe Specs

Three distinct aesthetic directions for the AuthorPage Hugo themes.
Each derived from real-world references, not preset palettes.

---

## Theme 1: INKWELL — "First Light Margins"

```
VIBE NAME: First Light Margins
REFERENCE: A poet's writing desk at dawn
EMOTION: Nostalgic
COLLISION: Manuscript margins + Scandinavian minimalism
ANTI-PATTERNS: No purple gradients, no tech startup energy, no AI-template aesthetics, no stock photos

COLORS:
- Primary: #2C2824 - dried ink on old paper, warm near-black
- Secondary: #8B7355 - worn leather bookmark, warm brown
- Background: #FAF6F0 - aged cotton paper, cream not white
- Accent: #C4956A - first light through curtains, warm amber
- Palette name: "Dawn Manuscript"

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Display: Libre Caslon Display - a beautiful Caslon revival, warm and literary
- Body: Alegreya Sans - designed for literary text, but the sans variant brings Scandinavian clean lines
- Character: Quiet, considered, like a well-set book page. Never shouts.

LAYOUT:
- Density: Sparse - Scandinavian minimalism meets generous book margins
- Shapes: Soft but not bubbly - gentle edges like deckled paper
- Signature element: Narrow text column centered on page (like a book block), with generous margins that breathe. Content feels like reading a printed page.

MOTION:
- Level: Barely perceptible - nostalgic things don't rush
- Signature animation: Gentle fade-in like light slowly filling a room at dawn. Elements materialize rather than enter.

WILDCARD:
- A near-invisible paper texture overlay on the background. You feel it more than see it - adds analog warmth to digital.
```

### Inkwell Design Notes

- **Hero**: Author photo + tagline in a centered, book-page layout. Photo could be circular or softly masked. Lots of vertical breathing room. Think "title page of a chapbook."
- **Book cards**: Clean, minimal — cover image with title and a one-line tagline below. No drop shadows. Subtle hover: a warm underline appears.
- **Blog posts**: Styled like journal entries. Date in small caps. Body text in a comfortable reading width (~65 characters).
- **Navigation**: Minimal top bar, text-only links. Could use small caps. No hamburger menu on desktop.
- **Footer**: Centered, minimal. Social links as text, not icons.

## Theme 2: PAPERBACK — "Terminal Bestseller"

```
VIBE NAME: Terminal Bestseller
REFERENCE: An airport bookstore
EMOTION: Delighted
COLLISION: Dust jackets + billboard design
ANTI-PATTERNS: No purple gradients, no SaaS pricing grids, no tech aesthetics, no generic template feel

COLORS:
- Primary: #1B2D45 - deep navy, like a classy dust jacket spine
- Secondary: #F5F1EB - quality book paper, warm off-white
- Background: #FFFFFF - bright airport bookstore lighting, clean white
- Accent: #E8453C - bestseller sticker red, demands attention
- Bonus: #D4A03C - gold foil award sticker, celebration
- Palette name: "Gate B12"

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Display: Sora - geometric sans with real personality, bold weights hit like a billboard
- Body: Bitter - slab serif designed for screen reading, bookish but modern
- Character: Confident, punchy, like the voice on a great dust jacket. Sells without being sleazy.

LAYOUT:
- Density: Rich but organized - like a curated bookstore shelf, packed but browsable
- Shapes: Mix of sharp billboard angles and soft rounded corners (like book covers)
- Signature element: A book cover grid/shelf that feels like browsing a real store. Covers at slight angles, overlapping edges, depth via subtle shadows.

MOTION:
- Level: Moderate - the energy of browsing and discovering
- Signature animation: Book cards that tilt slightly on hover, like pulling a book off the shelf to look at the cover. Satisfying and tactile.

WILDCARD:
- A "STAFF PICK" or "NEW" badge element that breaks the grid on the featured book. Slightly rotated, like someone slapped a sticker on it.
```

### Paperback Design Notes

- **Hero**: Big, bold, unapologetic. Latest book cover displayed LARGE with a punchy headline. "The new novel from [Author Name]" energy. CTA button for buying.
- **Book cards**: Cover-forward. Large cover images arranged like a bookstore display. Featured book gets hero treatment; backlist gets a tight grid.
- **Blog posts**: Magazine-style layout. Bold headlines, pull quotes, author photo thumbnail.
- **Navigation**: Sticky top bar with author name as "logo." Clear, bold nav links. Might include a "Latest Release" highlight link in accent color.
- **Footer**: Full-width, dark navy background. Newsletter signup prominent. Social links as branded icons.
- **Newsletter CTA**: Prominent, mid-page. "Get notified about new releases" with email input.

## Theme 3: TYPEWRITER — "Midnight Bureau"

```
VIBE NAME: Midnight Bureau
REFERENCE: A 1940s detective's office at midnight
EMOTION: Nostalgic
COLLISION: Pulp covers + brutalist concrete
ANTI-PATTERNS: No purple gradients, no friendly rounded UI, no tech startup vibes, no pastel anything

COLORS:
- Primary: #E8DCC8 - yellowed case file paper, warm cream
- Secondary: #6B5B4E - cigarette smoke brown, moody mid-tone
- Background: #1A1714 - midnight office, warm near-black
- Accent: #D4883A - amber desk lamp glow, warm gold
- Palette name: "Case File"

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Display: Bebas Neue - bold condensed all-caps, pure pulp cover energy with brutalist weight
- Body: IBM Plex Mono - institutional monospace, cleaner than typical typewriter fonts, has "bureau" authority
- Decorative: Special Elite (used sparingly) - actual typewriter letterforms for quotes or featured text
- Character: Direct, atmospheric, slightly dangerous. Like a narrator in a noir film.

LAYOUT:
- Density: Dense and layered - like a detective's desk covered in case files
- Shapes: Sharp, hard edges - brutalist concrete angles, no soft curves
- Signature element: Venetian blind shadow lines — horizontal stripe motif used as section dividers and decorative elements. Evokes light through half-closed blinds.

MOTION:
- Level: Subtle but deliberate - the slow pan of a noir camera
- Signature animation: Typewriter effect on key headlines — characters appear one by one with a slight randomized delay, as if being struck by mechanical keys.

WILDCARD:
- Redacted text elements: █████ blocks that reveal content on hover/click. Used for author bio teasers or book descriptions. "The truth about [REDACTED] will change everything."
```

### Typewriter Design Notes

- **Hero**: Dark, atmospheric. Author name in massive Bebas Neue caps. A single moody author photo with high contrast. Tagline typed out with typewriter animation on load. Desk lamp amber glow as a radial gradient behind content.
- **Book cards**: Styled like case files or dossiers. Cover image with a "classified" vibe. Title in condensed caps. Description in monospace. Amber accent on hover.
- **Blog posts**: Styled like typed reports. Monospace body text. Blog titles in condensed caps. Dates formatted like file stamps: "19.FEB.2026 // 23:47".
- **Navigation**: Top bar with author name in Bebas Neue. Nav links in monospace, uppercase, letter-spaced. Active link gets an amber underline.
- **Footer**: Minimal, dark. "Case closed" energy. Social links as monospace text with // separators.
- **Dark mode default**: This theme IS dark mode. Light mode variant available but secondary.

## Shared Design Principles (All Themes)

1. **Books are the hero** — Every theme treats book covers as primary visual content
2. **Author voice first** — Typography and layout serve the author's personality
3. **No tech debt vibes** — These are author sites, not dashboards
4. **Mobile-first responsive** — All themes must work beautifully on phones (readers browse on phones)
5. **Performance** — Hugo static output means fast loading; don't undermine it with heavy JS
6. **Accessibility** — All color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast ratios
7. **Theme swappable** — Same content, different themes, zero breakage

## Implementation Order

1. **Inkwell first** — simplest layout, establishes the template contract
2. **Paperback second** — adds complexity (newsletter, featured book hero)
3. **Typewriter third** — most complex (animations, dark mode, redacted elements)
