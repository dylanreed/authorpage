Welcome to my brand new author website! I'm excited to have a home on the web where I can share updates about my writing, upcoming releases, and the occasional behind-the-scenes look at my creative process.

## How to Write a New Blog Post

If you're reading this as the site owner, here's how to add your own posts:

1. Create a new file in the `content/blog/` folder
2. Name it something like `my-post-title.md`
3. Add the front matter at the top (the part between the `---` lines) with a title and date
4. Write your post in Markdown below the front matter
5. Commit the file — your site will update automatically!

That's it. Happy writing!
